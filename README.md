# Face-Detection
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc..

Note: You need to download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file.
